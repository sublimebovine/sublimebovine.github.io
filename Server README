You need to put your SQL password into the file before you run it.

If on windows and you have node, run it with node server.js
If you are on Linux idk.

Also, if you are on windows, run these commands in the directory you are running server.js from.
npm init -y
npm install express sqlite3 bcrypt body-parser

If you are on Linux idk.
